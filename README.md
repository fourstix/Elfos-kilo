# Elfos-kilo
A full screen editor for the Elf/OS written in 1802 Assembly language and based loosely on the [Kilo editor](https://github.com/antirez/kilo) by Salvatore Sanfilippo aka antirez and the [Elfos-Edit editor](https://github.com/rileym65/Elf-Elfos-edit) by Mike Riley.

Platform
--------
The Elf/OS kilo editor was written for an 1802 based Microcomputer running the Elf/OS operating system, such as the [Pico/Elf](http://www.elf-emulation.com/picoelf.html) by Mike Riley or the [1802-Mini](https://github.com/dmadole/1802-Mini) by David Madole or the [AVI Elf II](https://github.com/awasson/AVI-ELF-II) by Ed Keefe. A lot of information and software for the Pico/Elf, the 1802-Mini and the AVI Elf II can be found on the [Elf-Emulation](http://www.elf-emulation.com/) website and in the [COSMAC ELF Group](https://groups.io/g/cosmacelf) at groups.io.

The Elf/OS kilo editor were assembled and linked with updated versions of the Asm-02 assembler and Link-02 linker by Mike Riley. The updated versions required to assemble and link this code are available at [fourstix/Asm-02](https://github.com/fourstix/Asm-02) and [fourstix/Link-02](https://github.com/fourstix/Link-02).

Elf/OS Kilo Modes
-----------------
* **Insert Mode**
  * Characters are inserted into the text
  * Tab inserts spaces into the text
  * Enter inserts a new line at the beginning or end of a line
  * Enter splits a line at the cursor inside a line
  * Delete at the end of a line joins the current line with next line 
  * Backspace at the beginning of an empty line deletes the line
  * Split (Ctrl-L,S) can also be used to insert lines or split a line
  * Join (Ctrl-L,J) can also be used to join lines
   
* **Overwrite Mode** 
  * Characters overwrite existing characters in the text
  * Tab moves the cursor to the next tab stop position
  * Enter moves down to the beginning of the next line
  * Delete and backspace do not delete empty lines automatically 
  * Use Split (Ctrl-L,S) at the beginning or end of a line to insert an empty line
  * Use Split (Ctrl-L,S) to explicitly split a line at the cursor inside a line
  * Use Join (Ctrl-L,J) to explicitly join lines
  * Use Cut (Ctrl-L,X) to delete a line (and copy into the clip board)

Copy, Cut & Paste
-----------------
* Use Copy (Ctrl-L,C) to copy a line into the clip board 
* Use Cut (Ctrl-L,X) to delete a line and copy into the clip board 
* Use Paste (Ctrl-L,V) to paste a line from the clip board and insert above the current line

Text Limits
-----------
* Lines can have up to 124 characters per line
* Tabs are defined as 4 character tab stops (1, 5, 9, etc.)
  
File Limits
-----------
* Buffers are used to edit files larger than 120 lines 
* Each buffer has up to 120 lines
* A file can have up to 255 buffers
* Buffers are saved to temporary spill files, while the file is edited
* Spill files are created automatically when a large file is loaded 
* Spill files are named *__kilo.nn*, where nn is the 2 digit hex value of their index
* Spill files are deleted automatically when the application ends

Key Character Sequences
-----------------------
These key character sequences follow the VT102 terminal specification.  In the table below,
{ESC} is the Escape control character, ASCII 27, hex value $1B.  Should one of these keys not
behave as expected, you may need to configure your terminal program to return the expected
key character sequence. Note that the Delete key can have either one of two possible sequences.

<table>
<tr><th>Key</th><th>Character Sequence</th></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="2">Up (Arrow)</td><td>{ESC}[A</td></tr>
<tr><td>{ESC}A (See Note)</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="2">Down (Arrow)</td><td>{ESC}[B</td></tr>
<tr><td>{ESC}B (See Note)</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="2">Right (Arrow)</td><td>{ESC}[C</td></tr>
<tr><td>{ESC}C (See Note)</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="2">Left (Arrow)</td><td>{ESC}[D</td></tr>
<tr><td>{ESC}D (See Note)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Home</td><td>{ESC}[1~</td></tr>
<tr><td>Insert</td><td>{ESC}[2~</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="2">Delete</td><td>{ESC}[3~</td></tr>
<tr><td>DEL ($7F)</td></tr>
<tr><td>End</td><td>{ESC}[4~</td></tr>
<tr><td>PgUp</td><td>{ESC}[5~</td></tr>
<tr><td>PgDn</td><td>{ESC}[6~</td></tr>
<tr><td>Backspace</td><td>Ctrl+H ($08)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tab</td><td>Ctrl+I ($09)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shift+Tab</td><td>{ESC}[Z</td></tr>
<tr><td>Enter</td><td>Ctrl+M ($0D)</td></tr>
</table>

Note:  On some older DEC video terminals, the arrow keys send {ESC}A through 
{ESC}D instead of the ANSI sequences {ESC}[A through {ESC}[D.
